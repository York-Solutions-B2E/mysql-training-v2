# Lesson: Understanding The Basics of SQL CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

## Objective:

- To understand the purpose and structure of SQL.
- To learn how to use SQL to retrieve, modify, and manipulate data.
- To practice writing SQL queries.

## Pre-requisites:

- Basic understanding of relational databases.
- Access to the MySQL database container and a connected client.

## Outline:

#### What is SQL.

- SQL stands for Structured Query Language, and it is a programming language used to manage relational databases.
  The purpose of SQL is to allow users to interact with a database, retrieving and manipulating data in a structured
  and efficient manner.

- SQL is widely used in the industry, and its knowledge is crucial for database administrators,
  developers, and analysts.

- Statements: SQL is composed of several statements used to create, modify, and delete data. Some of the most common
  statements include SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE.

### Retrieving Data

In this topic, we will cover the essential aspects of using SQL to retrieve data from a table. We will begin by
demonstrating how to use the SELECT statement and the WHERE clause to filter data based on specific criteria, including
the different operators that can be used in a WHERE clause, such as =, <, >, and LIKE.

We will also show you how to use logical operators like AND and OR to combine multiple criteria. Additionally, we will
explore how to use the ORDER BY clause to sort data in a table, including the different options for sorting data like
ascending and descending and demonstrate how to sort data by multiple columns and how to use the LIMIT clause.

Finally, we will assign a practice project to help reinforce what you have learned.

###### Refer to ```select.demo.sql``` for demonstration

###### Refer to ```select.practice.sql``` for the practice project

###### Refer to ```select.key.sql``` for a solved practice project example

### Inserting Data

In this topic, we will cover the basics of inserting data into a table using the INSERT statement. We will also discuss
the
importance of formatting data properly to ensure successful insertion into the table.

Finally, we will assign a practice project to help reinforce what you have learned.

###### Refer to ```insert.demo.sql``` for demonstration examples

###### Refer to ```insert.practice.sql``` for the practice project

###### Refer to ```insert.key.sql``` for a solved practice project example

### Modifying Data

In this topic, we will cover the usage of the UPDATE statement in modifying data in a table. We will also discuss the
significance of properly formatting data for modification, as well as the importance of exercising caution when
modifying data.

Finally, we will assign a practice project to help reinforce what you have learned.

###### Refer to ```update.demo.sql``` for demonstration examples

###### Refer to ```update.practice.sql``` for the practice project

###### Refer to ```update.key.sql``` for a solved practice project example

### Deleting Data

In this topic, we will be discussing the DELETE statement in SQL, which is used to remove data from a table. We will
also be covering the importance of using caution when deleting data to avoid losing important information.

###### Refer to ```delete.demo.sql``` for demonstration examples

###### Refer to ```delete.practice.sql``` for the practice project

###### Refer to ```delete.key.sql``` for a solved practice project example

### Conclusion

This lesson aimed to provide a basic understanding of SQL and its CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
We discussed the purpose and structure of SQL and its importance in managing relational databases.
We then covered the four main SQL statements - SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE - and demonstrated how they can be
used to retrieve, add, modify, and delete data from a table.

We also provided practice projects for each of the four statements, allowing students to practice writing SQL queries
and gain confidence in using them. It is important to note the importance of properly formatting data for insertion
and modification, and the caution that should be exercised when modifying or deleting data.
